Original Code created, Developed and submitted on: 2011

use random number generation						                      = COMPLETE


begin the race at "square 1" of 70 squares				= COMPLETE

Each square represents a possible position				= COMPLETE

winner to reach or pass square 70 gets carrots and lettuce.		= COMPLETE

There is a clock that ticks once per second.				= COMPLETE

each tick, adjust the position of animals use functions
	moveTortoise and moveHare					= COMPLETE

track positions of the animals, 1 is starting 
	If animal not at 1, move the animal back to square 1		= COMPLETE

Generate percentages by random integer i in the range 1<= I <=10	= COMPLETE x for tortoise-y for Hare

Turtle performs a fast plod when 1<= I <= 5,slip when 6 <= i <= 7,		
	slow plod when 8<= i <=10.					= COMPLETE

Use a similar technique to move the hare.				= COMPLETE

Begin the race with BANG !!!!!AND THEY'RE OFF !!!!!			= COMPLETE

Each clock tick (loop repetition), print 70-position line			
 	show T for turtle and H for hare				= COMPLETE

Occasionally, they land on the same square. 
	Turtle bites the hare program outputs OUCH!!!			= COMPLETE

Make sure all output is blank except T, H or Ouch!!!
	(in case of a tie) should be blank.				= NOT IMPLEMENTED

After each line test equal/passed square 70(finish), print winner   	= COMPLETE

If turtle wins, print TORTOISE WINS!!! YAY!!!				= COMPLETE

If hare wins, print HARE WINS. YUCH!!					= COMPLETE

If both animals win on the same clock tick, print IT'S A TIE        	= NOT IMPLEMENTED
