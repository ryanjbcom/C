This simple game is called Tank War. 

My assignment was to take the original source code from the Game Programming, All in One text book; alter and apply colors to the game then compile it. Built with c++, both players control each of their tanks, roam around the level and hunt each other to the death.

 

My Tank war alter contains the following:

Block colors changed to GREEN.

Block Sizes are double (increased).

Player 1 tank color is RED.

Player 2 Tank color is GREY.

Game speed INCREASED.

The screen border color changed to RED.
